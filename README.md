# Run Apps On Startup

Ignore the fact that it's Run Apps On Startup should be RIOS i just thing that RION sounds better
 
I have made this all by myself,
RAON(Run Apps On Startup) is a tool that automatically opens when your pc is started, RAON can swap files between 1: Disabled, and 2: Startup with a cool menu.

## Setup Instructions ##

1: Download the Zip with all of the files in it, then copy it to clipboard(CTRL + C)

2: Press (Windows + R)

3: In the text field input ( shell:startup )

4: At the top press the text that says ( Programs )

5: Make a new folder called ( Dodo Co )

6: In the folder ( Dodo Co ) paste the ( RunAppsOnStartup.zip ) file from earlier 

7: Extract the RunAppsOnStartup.zip file, then open it if you see only 1 file and its a folder then open that one if not that is ok you will see 7 files either way

8: Move the following files into the Dodo Co folder: Disabled, Autostart.py

9: Delete the RunAppsOnStartup zip file and folder that you extracted

10: Inside the ( Dodo Co ) folder right click the ( Autostart.py ) file, at the bottom it will show 'Create Shortcut' press that then copy the new shortcut

11: Repeat steps 2 and 3

12: paste the shortcut, then go back to the folder ( Dodo Co ) and delete the shortcut you just made

(OPTIONAL) (RECOMMENDED) 13: Right-click the folder ( Disabled ) then click Send to > Create Desktop Shortcut

(OPTIONAL) (RECOMMENDED) 14: Right-click the file ( Startup.py ) then click Sent to > Create Desktop Shortcut

## How to use app ##

assuming you did step 11, now you can go to the desktop and youll see a shortcut, double click that, and put some other shortcuts in it for the example we will a shortcut named "Unity Hub" The shortcut will open unity hub, obviusly you dont have to use it with unity it can be any shorcut you want, also any file will work as long as its not called ( Autostart.py ) then turn off your pc and turn it back on or open the ( Autostart.py ) file and whenever you want you can restart the PC from the app, from here you will see 3 buttons, 2 Labels, and 2 List Boxes, when you add new file to the folder you will have to press reload, the top big box is the enabled list box the enabled box is where all of the enabled files are to disable then so that they won't start when your pc restarts just select what you want to disable and press the 'Disable The selected files' button then it moves to the bottom box, To enable somthing just do the same thing but select somthing from the bottom box and press the 'Enable The selected files' button. to test just enable something and restart pc
