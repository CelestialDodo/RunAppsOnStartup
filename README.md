## How to use app ##

assuming you did step 11, now you can goto the desktop and youll see a shortcut, double click that, and put some other shortcuts in it for the example we will a shortcut named "Unity Hub" the shortcut will open unity hub, obviusly you dont have to use it with unity it can be any shorcut you want, also any file will work as long as its not called ( Autostart.py ) then turn off your pc and turn it back on or open the ( Autostart.py ) file, from here you will see 3 buttons, 2 Labels, and 2 List Boxes, when you add new file to the folder you will have to press reload, the top big box is the enabled list box the enabled box is where all of the enabled files are to disable then so that they wont start when your pc restarts just select what you want to disable and press the 'Disable The selected files' button then it moves to the bottom box, To enable somthing just do the same thing but select somthing from the bottom box and press the 'Enable The selected files' button. to test just enable something and restart pc
